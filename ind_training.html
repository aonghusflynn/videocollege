  <h1>INDUSTRY STANDARD TRAINING </h1>
<p>Initially, our focus was on work with young people but not long after we opened the doors of our miniscule office by the Wornington Green Estate, four young men asked if they’d get a qualification and a job if they joined our programme.</p>

<p>We decided to offer a training programme that met industry standards and prepared young adults for work as new entrants.  We sought advice from Dinah Caine, then Chief Executive of Skillset, Sector Skills Council for the Audio-Visual Industries. Dinah set us on the path of delivering hands-on, production-based training and gaining, with the help of the London Film & Development Agency, accreditation for our training.</p>

<p>We also were determined that our training was easily available to all London’s diverse communities and, above all, to people who were unemployed or on low incomes. All our courses were free and we helped with childcare costs.Our training programme was for many years developed and run by our Director of Production Training, the much-missed Bruce Milliard, who worked at the BBC for over 30 years.  He brought all his experience of broadcast and training to the courses he developed at The Video College and great humanity and humour to his work with trainees. >> BRUCE film</p>

<p>We knew that not all trainees would go on to work in film and television  – some went on to further education or training whilst others used what they had learnt in different areas of employment but all gained invaluable skills and knowledge needed for the work place: self-confidence, professionalism and the ability to work independently while being part of a team.</p>

<p>Courses ranged from Open College Network (OCN)-accredited introductory courses to nine-month City & Guilds Level 3 Diplomas >>CITY & GUILDS TRAINEE FILMS   to Combined Production courses that offered more advanced training in Specialist Skills, also accredited by OCN. >>COMBINED PRODUCTION COURSE FILMS We also worked with other approved Industry training providers on three Skillset training programmes. <br>
</p>
<p>In 2010/'11 and 2013, we ran two film training programmes with 18-23 year olds from London's Black and Asian communities: <a href="http://www.thevideocollege.co.uk/training18.html/">RAINING FOR 18-23 YEAR OLDS</a><br>

The Video College programme was delivered in the context of production with experienced industry tutors providing specialist workshops in camera, sound, screenwriting, directing, production management and editing. There was an emphasis on the young trainees gaining craft and production skills and on story development and storytelling through film.
<p>Interspersed with the training/production programme, there were visits to Pinewood Studios and The Production Guild of Great Britain, and career and advice sessions focusing on participants broadening their knowledge of the industry how it works, what work opportunities are avaliable and what employers are looking for in new entrants.</p>
<p>As with previous programmes with this age group, an experienced youth film tutor ran regular, one-to-one support sessions. An established Placements Co-ordinator,  who had worked for many years in the industry, assisted with CVs, job applications and in identifying jobs and short work placements in areas of particular interest to individuals.</p>
<p>We screened their work at Channel 4 for an audience of potential employers and industry organisations and companies, keen to promote diversity. The screening gave an opportunity for identifying placements and work for the trainees, who benefited from practical advice from specialists in their chosen fields.</p>
<p>Within months, three trainees had gained work placements. One trainee took up a place on a BA theatre course and plans to move on to an MA in screenwriting and direction; another is applying his experience to a new job in international development; and a third trainee is on a carpentry course as a first step to fulfilling his ambition to work in set construction.</p>

<p><strong class="style64">Found Work in the Industry</strong>
<p>Nine of the 11 Second Light trainees continue to work in the industry: two in production roles on feature films (<em>Dark Tide </em>starring Halle Berry, Skyfall,  Les Miserables and Warner Brothers&rsquo; <em>Gravity</em>); other roles include working as:  a casual runner at Framestore; camerawoman/editor on Barclay&rsquo;s corporate videos; freelance cameraman/editor; in a facilities house; at Optomen TV; and as researcher/presenter on Channel 4&rsquo;s <em>Battlefront.</em>&nbsp; Ruth Antoine was presented with the Second Light New Talent Award at the First Light Awards 2011.
<p> A number of the group continue to work together on new productions.&nbsp; Selina Osei and Mawaan Rizwan were awarded funding from the London Borough Film Fund to make the comic and moving, <em>Jimmy will Play</em>, written and directed by Mawaan.
<p class="style64">BACKGROUND TO SECOND LIGHT
<p>The Video College was one of three organisations in England and Scotland selected to pilot <strong>SECOND LIGHT,</strong>  a First Light initiative supported by UK Film Council and Creative Skillset, Sector Skills Council for the Audio-Visual Industries.&nbsp; Our programme was largely delivered in the context of production with experienced industry tutors providing specialist workshops. There was an emphasis on the 10 young trainees gaining craft and production skills and on story development and storytelling through film.&nbsp; They produced <em>Routine </em>(06&rsquo; 30&rdquo;), <em>Magpie </em>(10&rsquo; 25&rdquo;), and eight films shot in a day (03&rsquo;00&rdquo;-05.00&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Interspersed with the training/production programme, there were a range of external visits and events, a seminar on distribution and exhibition, and masterclasses with established writers, directors and producers, all focused on participants broadening their knowledge of the industry, how it works, what work opportunities are available and what employers are looking for in new entrants.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our partners were the Production Guild of Great Britain, FT2, VET, BBC Multi-Platform Productions, National Film and Television School and Bournemouth Skillset Screen Academy.</p>
