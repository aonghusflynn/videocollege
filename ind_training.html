  <h1>INDUSTRY STANDARD TRAINING </h1>
<p>Initially, our focus was on work with young people but not long after we opened the doors of our miniscule office by the Wornington Green Estate, four young men asked if they’d get a qualification and a job if they joined our programme.</p>

<p>We decided to offer a training programme that met industry standards and prepared young adults for work as new entrants.  We sought advice from Dinah Caine, then Chief Executive of Skillset, Sector Skills Council for the Audio-Visual Industries. Dinah set us on the path of delivering hands-on, production-based training and gaining, with the help of the London Film & Development Agency, accreditation for our training.</p>

<p>We also were determined that our training was easily available to all London’s diverse communities and, above all, to people who were unemployed or on low incomes. All our courses were free and we helped with childcare costs.Our training programme was for many years developed and run by our Director of Production Training, the much-missed Bruce Milliard, who worked at the BBC for over 30 years.  He brought all his experience of broadcast and training to the courses he developed at The Video College and great humanity and humour to his work with trainees. <a href="https://vimeo.com/album/3870858/video/159059084">&gt;&gt; BRUCE film</a></p>

<p>We knew that not all trainees would go on to work in film and television  – some went on to further education or training whilst others used what they had learnt in different areas of employment but all gained invaluable skills and knowledge needed for the work place: self-confidence, professionalism and the ability to work independently while being part of a team.</p>

<p>Courses ranged from Open College Network (OCN)-accredited introductory courses to nine-month <a href="city-guilds-training.html">City & Guilds Level 3 Diplomas</a> to Combined Production courses that offered more advanced training in Specialist Skills, <a href="combined-production.html">also accredited by OCN</a>. We also worked with other approved Industry training providers on three Skillset training programmes. <br>
</p>
<p>In 2010/'11 and 2013, we ran two film training programmes with 18-23 year olds from London's Black and Asian communities: <a href="http://www.thevideocollege.co.uk/training18.html/">RAINING FOR 18-23 YEAR OLDS</a><br>
Jeremy Clark, a City & Guilds trainee in 1999, was trained by Bruce Milliard as technical assistant and tutor. He brought advanced skills to craft training on both programmes and a subtle understanding, developed over many years on our training and youth programmes, of how to keep students on track and prepare them for professional work.</p>
