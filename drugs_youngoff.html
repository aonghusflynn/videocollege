  <h1>DRUGS, CRIME AND FEAR OF CRIME</h1>
  <h2 align="center"><br>
  <span class="quote">&rdquo;I learnt the consequences drugs have on your body and also to your education&rdquo;</span></h2>
<h2>DRUG EDUCATION</h2>
<p>Young people increasingly were facing the temptation of drugs both from their peer group and because of the area they live in. By making them look hard at the risks of taking or dealing in drugs, it gave them an insight into how they could take control of the situation.</p>
<p>We worked alongside drug advice agencies, Youth Offending Teams, schools and, if possible, we got parents involved. Films were often screened in schools as part of the PSHCE curriculum and in local youth clubs and community centres.</p>
<br>
<h2>YOUTH OFFENDING AND CRIME PREVENTION</h2>
With Hammersmith &amp; Fulham Youth Offending Team, we regularly worked with 13-17 year olds at serious risk of entering a long&ndash;term cycle of offending and prison.

<h2>CHANCE TO CHANGE</h2>
<p><em>"As well as being fun, it keeps me off the streets and out of trouble. We made up our own stories and drew where the camera was going to be. It’s been very enjoyable and fun, although I came to learn about stopping crime and things like that.<br>
  Lots of tapes have been edited - not by the club staff but by us.  We have edited them ourselves. All of us have taken part, in fixing the camera and filming ourselves and acting. I haven’t re-offended, I’d only be out on the streets if I wasn’t here, I want to do it again." <br>
  <strong>14 year old male</strong> </em></p>
<p><p>For six years from 1995, The Video College worked with the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea’s Youth Offending Team (YOT) on a groundbreaking crime prevention project with 10-14 year olds at risk of re-offending. </p>

<p>During Ofsted inspections, a senior inspector visited:</p>
<p><em>"Excellent progress was made by young people in the well-conceived Chance to Change programme. Young people at risk of offending and those with court suspension orders successfully confronted their behaviour. They were assisted to develop their own strategies for dealing with aggressive or potentially violent behaviour. The young people had to work in pairs and as a small team, and developed good communication and negotiation skills. The young people were mature, listened well to each other and reflected on what they had learnt, demonstrating very good awareness of crime."</em></p>
<p>Chance to Change was run by Ioana Constantinescu for six years our youth co-ordinator and subsequently a much-valued freelance tutor.  It was highly successful in improving school attendance, preventing re-offending and decreasing referrals back to the Youth Offending Team by the police. It explored bullying, coping with school, relationships with teachers, peers and parents, drugs, crime and the implications of re-offending. By making the films themselves, young people gained a real insight into how these issues affected their lives and that there were alternatives to what they were doing. </p>


<h2>FEAR OF CRIME </h2>
<p>From the early ‘90s it was recognised that fear of crime was as, even more, prevalent than crime itself and a number of community safety initiatives addressed the need to allay the fears of all ages in all local communities.<br />
