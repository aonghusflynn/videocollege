  <h1>SCHOOL INCLUSION PROJECTS</h1>
  
  <p>As a local community organisation, we were a continuing presence, providing help and encouragement outside school. We appreciated that schools had times when there was more pressure on pupils and we structured our projects around that. Our one-to-one tutoring encouraged a bond with The Video College that often lasted for several years.</p>
  
  <p>We firmly believed in teaching young people real skills through video production and drama. Students, particularly those who had trouble with the written word, found a different way to approach the school curriculum and were able to reconnect with the mainstream.</p>


  <h2>Holland Park</h2>
  <p>A language and literacy project, assessed by the National Literacy Trust: “These pupils have a long history of turning their eyes away from everything they do not want to see.......The speech of the pupils became more fluent, confident and distinct as the actions proceeded.”</p>
  <h2>Sion Manning Roman Catholic Girls’ Secondary School</h2>
  <p>A group of young women who were at risk of exclusion used video and drama to celebrated their local area and its diverse communities.</p>
  <p>“The sessions were carefully planned, with thought given to the needs of the pupils that were attending. The project was very beneficial, especially when the girls saw their finished film.”<br/>

   <h2> Walmer Road</h2>
 
  <p>A programme with Walmer Road School, which works with young people excluded or self-excluded from school, led to students gaining an Arts Award.</p>
