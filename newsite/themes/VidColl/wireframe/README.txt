This is a very simple CSS only wireframe theme. It is not fork of the wireframe
theme by civicspace. That one is so tighly integrated into the CS theme system,
that I decided to make a simple, lean and clean one.

Notes:
The first commits are initial commits. The CSS is not hardened yet, it will
probably break on several modules and even on core.

drupal.css is still called. This is intentional. Because Drupal.css has a lot of
rather nice and unobstructive styles, it adds on to the wireframe. However, it
also has several ugly hardcoded styles. Plans are to pull them out of drupal.css
