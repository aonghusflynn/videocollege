  16-18 year old BTEC students at Paddington Academy produced, with support from industry tutors, a drama of a young man who has a surprising reason for begging. The Beggar was nominated for a Limelight Award.

  <h2>      SCHOOL INCLUSION PROJECTS</h2>
  <p>One of the problems schools face is the increase in truanting and under-achievement. For several years we&rsquo;ve worked alongside schools&rsquo; Inclusion Projects and Pupil Referral Units involving pupils at risk from exclusion or self-exclusion. We do this by encouraging these vulnerable students to explore issues such as bunking off, bullying, conflict between different groups, peer pressure and changes at school.</p>
  <p>We find that increasing pupils&rsquo; skill levels and their confidence to work with their peers, helps them to approach their education with a different attitude.</p>
  <p>We appreciate that schools have times when there is more pressure on pupils and we structure our projects around that. As a local community organisation, we&rsquo;re a continuing presence, giving help and encouragement. Students know that they can go on to other projects if they want to. Our on--to-one tutoring encourages a bond with The Video College that often lasts for several years.</p>
  <strong>FUTURE PLANS</strong><br>
  Government changes in the education system have meant that we are ideally placed to offer training and development to that all-important 14-19 age group. We are part of the Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster and Camden 14-19 partnership group and are set to deliver a programme from September 2009.  
  <p>We are concentrating on how to best to tackle the  problem of under-achievement. Our experience over the last 20 years has shown us that, working imaginatively with our partners, combined with our proven track record of helping young people learn new skills, can go some of the way to helping schools with this increasing problem.</p>
  <p>We firmly believe in teaching young people real skills through video production and drama. Students, particularly those who have trouble with the written word, acquire a different way to approach the school curriculum. Sometimes students need to be given a fresh approach if they are to reconnect with the mainstream.</p>
  <p>This is something we shall be taking further during the year.</p>
