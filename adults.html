<h1>PRODUCTION-BASED TRAINING PROGRAMMES WITH ADULTS FROM OUR TARGET GROUPS</h1>
<p>With this strand we want to highlight the experiences and concerns of under-represented communities. Alongside working with young people and adults on industry courses, we also work on projects where older people, 50+, and adults with learning disabilities, gain video skills and produce new work. </p>

<p>Why Me?, (19'51&quot;) their final production, was made by local mothers on a year-long production-based documentary course.   <br>
  Funded by The Art's Council's Lottery Scheme, Arts For Everyone, Why Me? was screened at the Curzon, Soho in June 2000 to an audience that included industry producers and a commissioning editor from Channel 4. </p>
<p>None of the participants had had the chance to take part in education and training for some years. We were able to help with locating and organising suitable childcare and paying childcare costs.</p>
<span class="quote style3">&quot;The big plus - the help with childcare and travel. Without it, I'd never have had this opportunity. It's manageable, 2 days out of the house.&quot;  </span>

<p>Text for Forward from Fifty Members of Open Age produced a documentary, &lsquo;Forward from Fifty&rsquo;. Made by a group committed to learning new video and technical skills, it explored attitudes to retirement and the advantages it can bring. We have future plans to work with other older groups on issues that interest and affect them.</p>

Students produced ads, a music video, dramas and &lsquo;Spirit of Life - Karma Attitudes&rsquo;, a documentary from a young Sikh man with cerebral palsy who investigated his religion&rsquo;s attitude to disability<br>

<p align="center" class="quote style3">&quot;I looked forward to every moment.
