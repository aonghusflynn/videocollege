<h1>PARTNERSHIP  PROJECTS WITH MIGRANT &amp; REFUGEE COMMUNITIES</h1>
<p align="center" class="quote">  &ldquo;I liked working in a group, being able to work on our own ideas, in our ownlanguage, for our own community&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
   This area of our work focused on building partnerships with local migrant and refugee organisations and creating wider opportunities for young people from minority communities. Young people or young people and adults working together created videos that portray the experience of growing up in London and sometimes the misunderstandings between generations and communities. </p>
<p>We also made a number of videos in Arabic for organisations that wanted to use video in different languages to reach members of communities, particularly women, who weren’t taking up local support services.</a></p>

<p align="left" class="footer">Created and performed in Arabic by members of the local Sudanese community the video highlighted the risks of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). The production was funded by the local Health Authority, as it was concerned that practice was still continuing and that women who were affected were not receiving adequate, local, medical care, particularly at marriage and during pregnancy and childbirth.</p>

Other partners were from organisations that worked with a range of local communities – Filipino, from the Horn of Africa – Baraka Youth, Horn Reflections, young people from the Eritrean Support Group, the Eritrean Parents and Children Association – Moroccan, Traveller and West Indian.

<h1 align="center">SCREENINGS</h1>

<p align="center"><img src="images/screenings1.png" width="75%"/></p>
<p>To publicise community productions, and the issues they raise, we held screenings in local venues, such as youth clubs, schools, local cinemas, professional screening studios and community centres. Some videos were shown in public places such as outpatients&rsquo; departments, sports centres, housing association foyers and local authority conferences. Others were used by the health service for training or by teachers as part of their pupils&rsquo; social education. We also distributed videos to libraries, and submitted them to festivals and broadcast channels.</p>
