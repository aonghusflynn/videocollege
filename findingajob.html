  <p><br>
       From 2000, with funding from the Big Lottery, we employed a Placements Co-ordinator who was regularly in touch with potential employers – broadcasters, production companies, facility and post-production houses – where young people and trainees could get on the first rung of the ladder.<br>
        Alongside career guidance, including help on how to write a good CV, covering letter or email and application form, trainees had support in identifying opportunities, and applying for, further education and training, work placements and employment.  </p>
</div>
<p>We provided paid work for ex-trainees, who were the crews on our commissioned productions, continuing career and business advice, and support to ex-trainees in the development of their own productions and submitting their work to festivals.</p>
<p>We ran courses in ‘Becoming a Freelancer’, which helped trainees to plan their careers, with panels of working industry professionals describing their routes into the industry and their current jobs.  The courses also included information about tax and NI, practical exercises in completing a tax return, advice about keeping financial records and how to negotiate the transition from income support to freelance work.</p>
<p>At the end of courses, we held screenings in London cinemas - the Curzon Soho and Mayfair, and the Electric – and screening rooms.  The screenings were introduced by key figures in film and television. The screenings were introduced by key figures in film and television – established producers and directors, as well as the Head of Training and Development at the BBC, the Director of NFTS and the Chief Executives of Skillset and the Production Guild.  Audiences were made up of industry professionals and employers looking for new talent and with whom trainees could make contact and gain advice and encouragement.</p>
