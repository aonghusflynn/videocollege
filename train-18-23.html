<h1>TRAINING FOR 18-23 YEAR OLDS</h1>
<h2>SECOND LIGHT</h2>

<p>The Video College was one of three organisations in England and Scotland selected to pilot Second Light, a First Light initiative funded by the UK Film Council and Skillset. Eleven 18-23 year olds from London&#39;s Black and Asian communities joined the year-long programme of film training. Nine soon found work, two in production roles on feature films, and eight continue to build careers in the industry.</p>
<h2>The Programme</h2>
<p><em>Second Light</em> was delivered in the context of production with experienced industry tutors providing specialist workshops.</p>

<h1 class="style66" align="center">I believe the College projects achieved two different and apparently contradictory things by taking a disparate group of individuals and moulding a Production team from them while simultaneously encouraging each of the team members to explore and express their unique talents individually. Neat trick!<br/><br/>
Their lack of a sense of entitlement, the work ethic the College has impressed on them, and their genuine enthusiasm sets them apart from other new entrants that we often field test and reject.

Brian Donovan, Line Producer<br/>
Second Light Production Management tutor
</p>

<p>
There was an emphasis on the 10 young trainees gaining craft and production skills and on story development and storytelling through film.  They produced Routine (06’ 30”), Magpie (10’ 25”), and, with additional funding from the FT2 Legacy Fund, eight films shot in a day (03’00”-05.00”)
</p>

<p>
A range of external visits and events, a seminar on distribution and exhibition, and masterclasses with established writers, directors and producers, all focused on participants broadening their knowledge of the industry, how it works, what work opportunities are available and what employers are looking for in new entrants.   Our partners were the Production Guild of Great Britain, FT2, VET, BBC Multi-Platform Productions, National Film and Television School and Bournemouth Skillset Screen Academy.
</p>

<h2>Screening at the Curzon Soho</h2>

<p>Mike Hodges, Director of <em>Get Carter</em>, <em>Croupier</em>, <em>I’ll Sleep When I’m Dead</em> and Patron of The Video College, introduced the screening which was followed by a Q&amp;A with established film professionals.
</p>

<h2>Ready to Work</h2>
<p>
Following the success of Second Light, in 2013 we ran Ready to Work in Film with funding from the ITF/FT2 (Independent Training Fund/Film &amp; Television Freelance Training) Legacy Fund.
