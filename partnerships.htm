		    <p align="center" class="quote"><strong>&ldquo;Our partnerships are key to <br>
	        the success of the college</strong><strong>&rdquo; </strong></p>
		    <p align="left">Our experience is that voluntary and statutory agencies, and local organisations are increasingly using film to support and develop their work. We have worked in partnership with many such groups to help them reach new users and publicise their services. Our videos are also used for training or informing staff, parents and carers.</p>
		    <p align="left">Local migrant and refugee community organisations and departments of the health care service, want to encourage more people from minority communities to take up their services or to disseminate information. Film in different languages can reach people who neither read nor easily understand English and we are especially well placed to help as our own students are often from these communities.</p>
		    <p align="left">With these projects we take the role of executive producer and employ trainees as crew or assistants to experienced professionals.</p>

		    </p>
		    <p>St John's Church, Notting Hill received Heritage Lottery funding towards the restoration of the church's 18th century organ.</p>
		    <p>19 young people with The Video College made a short film that documents the long and intricate process of restoring the organ. This included a 2 day shoot at  the organ restorer's, TW Fearn, in Gittisham Devon, where they filmed the detailed work of its experts.</p>

    <h1 align="center">Smooth Guide to Golborne: Film Guide to Local Services</h1>
		    <p align="left">From 2001 - 2003, the film guide highlighted the services in our local ward, Golborne - Supplementary Schools, Swinbrook Nursery, Sixty Plus and the Venture Community Association.</p>

    <p align="left">With support from the Director of Community Production the videos were shot and edited on AVID by ex-trainees. </p>
		    <p align="left">An elderly resident enjoyed the screening at the Venture Centre:</p>
		    <p align="left">&quot;because you can't see what's going on in the area or maybe just notice the bad things and it was very nice to see all the good activities that are going on for people&quot;</p>

		    <p align="center" class="navbottom"><img src="/images/FGM music.jpg" width="269" height="190"></p>
    <p align="left" class="footer">Created and performed in Arabic by members of the local Sudanese community the video highlighted the risks of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). The production was funded by the local Health Authority as it was concerned that practice was still continuing and that women who were affected were not receiving adequate medical care, particularly at marriage and during pregnancy and childbirth. The video was used in the community, for training of health professionals and screened at a conference of FORWARD which works internationally to end FGM. There is now a specialist unit at St. Mary's Paddington.</p>

		    <p>Educational film for Kensington &amp; Chelsea's and Hampshire's Social Services Departments. </p>
    <p align="left">The film was used by the Council's Children's Resource Teams which work with young people living in care. It is aimed at teachers, including trainee teachers, carers and parents and, as part of a Government initiative, highlights the importance of education for young people in care and the barriers and difficulties which they may face.</p>
